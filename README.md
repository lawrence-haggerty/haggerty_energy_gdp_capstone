Executive Summary

There has been a consistent axiom since the beginning of the industrial revolution that energy drives commerce. The purpose of this project is to investigate how the production and consumption of energy compares to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at the state and national level. Specifically, this investigation will focus on comparison of three separate categories within the energy sector: fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy with the intent of understanding the trajectory for movement away from fossil fuel as our primary energy source and its alignment to the nation’s leading fiscal metric.  

Motivation

I have been aware of the need to develop and implement alternatives to fossil fuels since I was a child growing up during the “Energy Crisis” of the 1970s. I have been impressed with the move away from fossil fuels and adoption of renewable energy over the last few decades. I would like to leverage this interest as part of my final project and provide insight to others on how the nation is transitioning from fossil fuel-based energy and the economic implications at the state and national level. 

Data Questions

How does energy production and consumption compare to GDP per capita at the state and national level?


  •	What differences in the mix of energy (fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy) and consumption rates can be identified across the states. What contributes to these differences.

  •	What states have seen the greatest and least amount of growth in GDP per capita when compared to corresponding years for production and consumption of energy (considering all energy sources combined and fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy separately)?

  •	What has been the growth rate at the state and national level for GDP per capita and production and consumption of energy (considering all energy sources combined and fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy separately)?

  •	Where have negative impacts been observed. Can additional contributing factors be identified?
  
  •	What technological advances are spurring the most growth in non-fossil fuel energy and can an economic impact be determined?

  •	Stretch Question: What are the projections for continued growth in non-fossil fuels and does this appear to have a positive impact on the future economy?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

My final product will be delivered in both a PowerPoint presentation and interactive Power BI dashboard. 

Analysis will primarily be conducted utilizing SQL and may be augmented with coding in python. Visualizations will be developed as static images in PowerPoint and an interactive dashboard utilizing Power BI.
